More ideas
----------
I REALLY NEED TO SYNC THIS (one way or another, idk) WITH SPEC/SRC/UNSURE.MD

Definitely going in, need finalising
------------------------------------

Boolean operators use keywords

Figure out how to do optional and named arguments

Not sure
--------

Units
- some variables can optionally be assigned a unit and multipliers can automatically be added
mut a = 13µm;
a += 10nm;
- many problems
- functions like sqrt modify types
- 10m/5s = 2ms^-1 or something


Operators
- define custom operators?
- @ for deref
- ugh maybe I should have a range operator
- maybe more like
	- sqrt
	- square
	- append
	- reverse (~)
	- split
	- `in`
	- len (#)
	- divisibility
- chained operators, a < b < c
	- perhaps support ≤ for <= etc for the lolz
	- maybe that could also be the range syntax
		- for 3 < x < 10 {}
		- for x < 10 {}
	

Pipe operator
- like functional languages
- [3,2,1] |> sorted |> fn(n:i32)->i32 = n + 1

Partial application
- like functional languages again
- helps previous
- maybe some syntax sugar in conjunction with/instead of partial application
	- [3, 2, 1] |> add(1, $) where that creates a lambda and passes in the value piped in as $
		- maybe have $add(1, $)
	- perhaps better lambdas, like \x -> map f x like in haskell
		- but I don't like \
		- seen lambda syntax of [n → n+1], don't think it would fit but maybe good ideas

Maybe I should not have operator precedence
- maybe implicit parens lol, 1 * 2+3 == 1 * (2 + 3)

Lua-style string literals
- allows nesting, cos opening != closing

Generalised <something>= syntax
- like +=, -= etc but works on any function
- a max= b is sugar for a = max(a, b)
- a foo= (b, c) is sugar for a = foo(a, b, c)


Really should have some kind of built-in GUI, args processor, whatnot like py for a reasonably good experience, but not to detract from 3rd party libraries

Compile-time guarentees (also can be specified by the programmer) that values will be in certain ranges

See side effects at method usage
- maybe just mem, but others as well. show where memory is being allocated because that's important
